**`Abstract`**：In this paper, we generalise the idea of rotational-XOR cryptanalysis to SIMON-like block ciphers, a class of AND-RX ciphers with a rotational-invariant round function. We analyse the theoretical evaluation of RX-diﬀerences passing through SIMON-like ciphers, and formulate an SMT model for searching rotationalXOR characteristics in SIMECK and SIMON. As an application, we ﬁnd a 15-round RX-characteristic in SIMECK32 with probability 2^{−16} under 240 weak keys, and a 16-round one for SIMECK48 with probability 2−20 under 270 weak keys. The characteristics can be further extended to 19/25 rounds for SIMECK32/SIEMCK48, respectively. For SIMON32, the RX-characteristicswe ﬁnd cover up to11 rounds with probability 2−24. The RX-characteristics in SIMECK32 and SIMECK48 cover more roundsthanthebestrelated-keydiﬀerentialcharacteristicsandintegraldistinguishers, and when the number of rounds equals, RX-characteristics require less data to detect. In addition, we study the impact of key schedule on RX-characteristics in SIMON-like ciphers. It appears that adopting the same structure in the round function and the key schedule of SIMECK makes it more vulnerable to RX-cryptanalysis than its non-symmetric counterpart SIMON.
